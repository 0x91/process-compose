Using multiple `process-compose` files lets you to customize a `process-compose` application for different environments or different workflows.

### Understanding multiple Compose files

By default, `process-compose` reads two files, a `process-compose.yml` and an optional `process-compose.override.yml` file. By convention, the `process-compose.yml` contains your base configuration. The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing processes or entirely new processes.

If a process is defined in both files, `process-compose` merges the configurations using the rules described in [Adding and overriding configuration](#adding-and-overriding-configuration).

To use multiple override files, or an override file with a different name, you can use the `-f` option to specify the list of files. `process-compose` merges files in the order theyâ€™re specified on the command line. 

When you use multiple configuration files, you must make sure all paths in the files are relative to the base `process-compose` file (the first `process-compose` file specified with `-f`). This is required because override files need not be valid `process-compose` files. Override files can contain small fragments of configuration. Tracking which fragment of a process is relative to which path is difficult and confusing, so to keep paths easier to understand, all paths must be defined relative to the base file.

### Example use case

#### Different environments

A common use case for multiple files is changing a development `process-compose` app for a production-like environment (which may be production, staging or CI). To support these differences, you can split your `process-compose` configuration into a few different files:

Start with a base file that defines the canonical configuration for the processes.

**process-compose.yml**

```yaml
processes:
  web:
    command: "npm start"
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: process_started
      cache:
        condition: process_started

  db:
    command: "pg_ctl start -l logfile"

  cache:
    command: "systemctl start redis"
```

In this example the development configuration adds debug flags.

**process-compose.override.yml**

```yaml
processes:
  web:
    environment:
      - "DEBUG=true"

  db:
    command: "pg_ctl start -l logfile -d"

```

When you run `process-compose` it reads the overrides automatically.

Now, it would be nice to use this `process-compose` app in a production environment. So, create another override file (which might be stored in a different git repo or managed by a different team).

**process-compose.prod.yml**

```yaml
processes:
  web:
    environment:
      - "PRODUCTION=true"

  cache:
    environment:
      - "TTL=500"
```

To deploy with this production `process-compose` file you can run

```shell
$ process-compose -f process-compose.yml -f process-compose.prod.yml
```

This deploys all three processes using the configuration in `process-compose.yml` and `process-compose.prod.yml` (but not the dev configuration in `process-compose.override.yml`).

### Adding and overriding configuration

`process-compose` copies configurations from the original process over to the local one. If a configuration option is defined in both the original process and the local process, the local value *replaces* or *extends* the original value.

For single-value options like `command`, `working_dir` or `disabled`, the new value replaces the old value.

original process:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    command: python app.py
```

local process:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    command: python otherapp.py
```

result:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    command: python otherapp.py
```

For the **multi-value options** `environment`, `depends_on`, `process-compose` merges entries together with locally-defined values taking precedence:

original process:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    environment:
      - "A=3"
      - "C=8"
```

local process:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    environment:
      - "A=4"
      - "B=5"
```

result:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    environment:
      - "A=4"
      - "B=5"
      - "C=8"
```

### Configuration Inheritance with `extends`

`process-compose` provides the `extends` keyword to simplify configuration file inheritance:

```yaml
# ./some/dir/process-compose.prod.yaml
version: "0.5"
extends: "process-compose.yaml"

processes:
```

```yaml
# ./some/dir/process-compose.yaml
version: "0.5"

processes:
```

This is equivalent to running:

```shell
$ process-compose -f ./some/dir/process-compose.yaml -f ./some/dir/process-compose.prod.yaml
```

And allows you to use the shorter command:

```shell
$ process-compose -f ./some/dir/process-compose.prod.yaml
```

With the same result.

**Notes**:

1. Inheritance chains are limited only by available memory.
2. Circular inheritance will cause loading to fail.
3. The `extends` path is relative to the extending file's location (as shown in the example above).
4. Absolute paths are automatically detected and used as-is.
5. The `.env` file is loaded only from the `CWD`. Additional env files can be specified using `--env` (`-e`).
6. If file `B` uses the `extends` keyword to extend file `A`, loading both with `process-compose up -f A -f B` will fail. Load only the last file in the chain with `process-compose -f B` instead.
